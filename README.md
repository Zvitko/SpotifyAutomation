# Spotify Automation
Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby using Cucumber, Gherkin, and Watir web driver.

Created an automated testing suite that checks for successful and different variations of failed login attempts. I have a working file that is not yet complete called [stat_page](https://github.com/Zvitko/SpotifyAutomation/blob/master/features/Project1/pages/stat_page.rb) 
that will load a UI that utilizes a Spotify api to gather your top 50 played songs and package them into a playlist on your profile.  

Feel free to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and make any changes to my project followed by a 
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 

## Documentation
I used Ruby v3.0.0 and you can find that documentation [here](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/)

See [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) for installing/configuring all gems.

See [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/) for links to documentation on Gherkin, feature, and step_files.

See [Watir](http://watir.com/guides/) for setting up the web driver, creating a session, scanning HTML elements, and much more.
